Hi Elfie, this is my number 97615390.
I am ready. Are you? Call you now or later?
I left early last night because I was quite affected by all the university stuff which you are kept talking about. Also, I feel that Lien, Gen, Weiyi and you don't have much to talk about.
Talked too long. Not selling cheese cake already. Haha.
