Can see that you are very sad. Please don't be, there are many other first time in future. Cheer up ok?
Yes, it's a last minute decision. With my father's friend.
I reach already. Find me at the lesser people public phones corner.
I don't know. And she never tells us, right? She only told Ben. You ask her. Ben booked a room at Sentosa.
How much I have?
Hey, are you still in school? Do you want to go lunch with me and Wei Yi?
Morning. Sailing off later. Take care.
But I don't look good with short fringe! Sob. Oh well, it's cut. So after you cut, we go and dye our hair together? Good luck for your papers!

Hi Paul, how was your day? I am Lea, female, 25. You?
Hey, you have UNIX account in SOC? Can lend me your password and UNIC account? I just want to try something, can? Thanks.
Ok. See you.
Then too bad for me. Anyway, doesn't really matter also.
I can't tell first. Later you will know one. I Can.
Haha. You all don't go dieting without me. Wait for me. Oh yes, I just emailed you the website to the photos. Got time then go and see.
What're you doing tonight?
They are inside the restaurant.
Really, how much?
Are you Yijue?
Leaving around that time too. Bringing laptop home?
Yeah. Said going with Wawa. Still must take MRT. Sigh.
Night has end for another day, morning has come in a special way. May you smile like the sunny rays and leaves your worries at the blue blue bay.
Ok, can you message me your IC number and address? You and Yiyun are together right? Or separated?
You can go and wear an uniform and then you can get tickets to watch "Turn Left Turn Right".
Really. Oh, nearer to my workplace and Stella chose one.
Haha, you are very funny. Ah, forget it. When we do our project we also make some mistakes. Face skin thicker. Never mind one.
Hehe. Don't say like that. I am very responsible. You go and enjoy the show. Call me later okay?
Oh, ok.
Hey, I heard postings are out online. Go and check!
Pick you at 9:30PM. Behind.

You bought your camera at which shop?
I didn't enlarge and see, so not sure got cute guys or not. Yes, got you inside, wow so sweet you are. Yes, the big heart one is quite nice, but yours is more creative.
Ok. I'm at City Link already.
What are you doing now? Asleep yet?
I see. Remember to let me know when you come back.
Jess, what are you working as?
Haha, I remembered! She's my "lover" now. Cedes what time were you there? Is she still there?
Oh, want to go there?
I can't understand my Linear Algebra tutor. I think he is from China. Cannot understand what he is saying.
Hi. How was calculus? Feel that the lecture is not so beneficial. The textbook seems enough. Don't know whether I want to continue coming or not.
Mick, go to die.
Hey. It's Harry Potter out today. Ask daddy to buy for me! It's 33 bucks in popular.
Hah in what way it is not nice?
Where are you all going?
One moment.
Hey J! Are you feeling any better? Hope so honey. I am now feeling ill and I think I may have tonsillitis as well! Damn. I am laying in bed feeling real bored. Lots of love.
Can I confirm with you the time tomorrow?
Oh. Again. Wow. You are like very nice for these few weeks.
And if you are working as waitress or telemarketer, I think part timer better, and get a few if you find the hours not enough. One of my ODAC friend earned quite a bit like that. And always go out.
Yes.
He told u I'm already considering. I don't know, I'm not very interested in the show & I don't want to go out on both weekends. Sunday we're meeting for lunch with the rest right?
What are you eating?
I'm working. Are you ireena?
After my driving then I will be free. Why?
Are you colour blind? It's blue, not pink.
Oh. Ok. Good! Thank goodness you forgot. Is everything ok? Or now the point system drops already?
Yes. Can say hi and then go for dinner later. He likes doing project.
Hi, are you male?
What are you doing?
At a store outside Emporium.

She says that you can go for any class for the 12 lessons. Then that unlimited one for 3 months is 330. I haven't sign up yet.
