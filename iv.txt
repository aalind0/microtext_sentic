If you take then how I take bus later? Inside got money or not?
No, no sports car for me. I've gotten into lots of accidents for my love of speed. Furthermore, it's too expensive for me already. So I changed to a normal car.
No problem. Maybe next time when you are free.
Oh. Look that. I am your monkey partner.
Can I come? Why got free one? Friday I'm going to school.

Haha. I'm going to buy sandals. How to go Queensway? Any cute hunks around? Wow, so late.
Yes. Sure. Evening right?
Yeah, I haven't chat with you for a long time. I want to know how you have been recently. Maybe I can help you out after my course ends. I just came back this afternoon from field camp.
Was it Celine or you who was trying to message me? My handphone number is +6590957823.
No, because I didn't get an A for GP last year. If your work is making you tired, you should quit as soon as possible. Find a less taxing job. You will have more time to go out too.
Lunch.
Right. As long as you don't mind, I'm ok with it.
But please come. Are you going next week? Ask you where you want to go.
OK, then I will try to get back to you before 1200 tomorrow. Thank you and have a good night.
Why do you study till so late? Because I took up your daytime? I want to do a bit of my other project first before I sleep. So I am not sleeping yet.
Ok. I buy dinner for them now already.

I think it's Sun Fire. I am online, but I could not dial in to that school.
I think Morning to 3 is Fion's free time on Saturday. So shall we have breakfast or lunch? Any suggestions?

I think so. You started studying already? I need to copy your lecture notes. Haha.
What? Which work place? The day one. I don't think so. It's a super small company. Being the telemarketer. It is low paying. Starting pay is 5 dollars per hour and for 2 hours only. Do you want it? But I don't mind changing telemarketer job.
Ok I told him, next time see you can say hi to you, you can do that too, haha.

Ok. We meet at that time. If anyone's late, then get seats first.
Wow. No lecture? Then you call me ok? I am free from 12 to 2pm.
I have a little angel flying around with a hammer. Each person he hits gets a little bit of my love and concern. I think he'll beat the crap out of you.
Crazy? It's normal. He will do the same for Audrey them all also.
Hello people, happy prosperous new year. May you enjoy good health and wealth this year. Don't eat too much and see you all soon. Take care. Elaine.

Hey, girls. I heard from Jo that there is going to be a barbeque at Julia's house next Saturday. So keep yourselves free. Maybe we can celebrate Yin's birthday there on Sunday. Hee.
My sister has student price. I don't know we have student price or not. I don't know. I think the unlimited one more worth it. But only if you go for it.
Yes. After my work. Ah, but will you all be going out for dinner?
Sunny! Change conversation? Are you Malay or Chinese? My real name. Why?
Sigh this kind of thing cannot rush. Today is my first day only. Must search slowly. Don't worry. I will update to you.
